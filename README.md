### Organisation of Git Repository
Upon initialisation, I created a `dev` branch to use as my development branch when developing the system. Each time I would reach what I considered a key milestone in the system's progress, I would push that `dev` build to the `main` branch.
Updates were frequent and ranged in scale, varying from updates as small as singular CSS line changes, to full features being implemented across consecutive updates.
These updates were never specific to the frontend or backend. Whatever I felt like working on was whatever got updated.

### Description of Data Structures
In the client side, there are multiple data structures that represent users, groups, channels, and messages. These structures are directly managed within Angular components and LocalStorage:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
